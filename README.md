# YouTubify
Ryhtm bot used to only work with YouTube so I created this to allow for playlists on spotify to be convereted to YouTube playlists. This was my first time in python and using OAuth. This definetly could be imporoved

Need to add a secrets.py and youtube_requirments.json files to access the API's
